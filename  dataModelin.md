## SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained :

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 

- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
-  SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. 
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb

## SQL Database Examples:
- MySQL Community Edition.
- MS-SQL Server Express Edition
- Oracle Express Edition
## NoSQL Database Examples:
- MongoDB
- CouchDB

- The Table Name, which is located at the top of the table.
- The Primary Keys.  Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more.  When the key has more than one column, it is called a compound key.
- Table Columns : There can be one or more table columns.  To keep the diagrams simple, I donâ€™t show the data types.  I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.
- Foreign Key : This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.
