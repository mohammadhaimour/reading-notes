# Using combineReducers:

## Core Concepts

The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same `(state, action) `signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.

Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the `combineReducers` utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.

There are several important ideas to be aware of when using `combineReducers`:

- First and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers. You are not required to use it in your own application, and it does not handle every possible scenario. It is entirely possible to write reducer logic without using it, and it is quite common to need to write custom reducer logic for cases that combineReducer does not handle. (See Beyond combineReducers for examples and suggestions.)

- While Redux itself is not opinionated about how your state is organized, combineReducers enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors. (See combineReducers for details.)

- One frequently asked question is whether Redux "calls all reducers" when dispatching an action. Since there really is only one root reducer function, the default answer is "no, it does not". However, combineReducers has specific behavior that does work that way. In order to assemble the new state tree, combineReducers will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed. So, in that sense, using combineReducers does "call all reducers", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping.

- You can use it at all levels of your reducer structure, not just to create the root reducer. It's very common to have multiple combined reducers in various places, which are composed together to create the root reducer.

## Defining State Shape :

There are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state. First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument. This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined. These two approaches are described in more detail in Initializing State, but there are some additional concerns to be aware of when using combineReducers.

combineReducers takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys. This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object. The correlation between these names is not always apparent, especially when using ES6 features such as default module exports and object literal shorthands.

Here's an example of how use of ES6 object literal shorthand with combineReducers can define the state shape:

```js
// reducers.js
export default theDefaultReducer = (state = 0, action) => state

export const firstNamedReducer = (state = 1, action) => state

export const secondNamedReducer = (state = 2, action) => state

// rootReducer.js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'

import theDefaultReducer, {
  firstNamedReducer,
  secondNamedReducer
} from './reducers'

// Use ES6 object literal shorthand syntax to define the object shape
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  theDefaultReducer,
  firstNamedReducer,
  secondNamedReducer
})

const store = createStore(rootReducer)
console.log(store.getState())
// {theDefaultReducer : 0, firstNamedReducer : 1, secondNamedReducer : 2}
```

Notice that because we used the ES6 shorthand for defining an object literal, the key names in the resulting state are the same as the variable names from the imports. This may not always be the desired behavior, and is often a cause of confusion for those who aren't as familiar with ES6 syntax.

Also, the resulting names are a bit odd. It's generally not a good practice to actually include words like "reducer" in your state key names - the keys should simply reflect the domain or type of data they hold. This means we should either explicitly specify the names of the keys in the slice reducer object to define the keys in the output state object, or carefully rename the variables for the imported slice reducers to set up the keys when using the shorthand object literal syntax.

A better usage might look like:

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'

// Rename the default import to whatever name we want. We can also rename a named import.
import defaultState, {
  firstNamedReducer,
  secondNamedReducer as secondState
} from './reducers'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  defaultState, // key name same as the carefully renamed default export
  firstState: firstNamedReducer, // specific key name instead of the variable name
  secondState // key name same as the carefully renamed named export
})

const reducerInitializedStore = createStore(rootReducer)
console.log(reducerInitializedStore.getState())
// {defaultState : 0, firstState : 1, secondState : 2}



```
This state shape better reflects the data involved, because we took care to set up the keys we passed to combineReducers.


# combineReducers(reducers) :
As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.

The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()

Example:
```js
rootReducer = combineReducers({potato: potatoReducer, tomato: tomatoReducer})
// This would produce the following state object
{
  potato: {
    // ... potatoes, and other state managed by the potatoReducer ...
  },
  tomato: {
    // ... tomatoes, and other state managed by the tomatoReducer, maybe some nice sauce? ...
  }
}
```

You can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object. For example, you may call combineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer }) for the state shape to be { todos, counter }.

A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: combineReducers({ counter, todos }). This is equivalent to writing combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos }).

###  Arguments

1-reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.


### Returns

(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.

### Notes

This function is mildly opinionated and is skewed towards helping beginners avoid common pitfalls. This is why it attempts to enforce some rules that you don't have to follow if you write the root reducer manually.

Any reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules:

- For any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument.

- It must never return undefined. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early return statement, so combineReducers throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.

- If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be undefined either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being undefined.

While combineReducers attempts to check that your reducers conform to some of these rules, you should remember them, and do your best to follow them. combineReducers will check your reducers by passing undefined to them; this is done even if you specify initial state to Redux.createStore(combineReducers(...), initialState). Therefore, you must ensure your reducers work properly when receiving undefined as state, even if you never intend for them to actually receive undefined in your own code.

Example

`reducers/todos.js`

```js
export default function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([action.text])
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

`reducers/counter.js`

```js
export default function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

`reducers/index.js`

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import todos from './todos'
import counter from './counter'

export default combineReducers({
  todos,
  counter
})
```


`App.js`

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import reducer from './reducers/index'

const store = createStore(reducer)
console.log(store.getState())
// {
//   counter: 0,
//   todos: []
// }

store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  text: 'Use Redux'
})
console.log(store.getState())
// {
//   counter: 0,
//   todos: [ 'Use Redux' ]
// }
```


### Tips
- This helper is just a convenience! You can write your own combineReducers that works differently, or even assemble the state object from the child reducers manually and write a root reducing function explicitly, like you would write any other function.

- You may call combineReducers at any level of the reducer hierarchy. It doesn't have to happen at the top. In fact you may use it again to split the child reducers that get too complicated into independent grandchildren, and so on.
