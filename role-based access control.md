# Role Based Access Control: 

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.
___
### Benefits of RBAC?
- With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. 
- Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

- RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

- The data breach you prevent may be your own.
___
## Access control lists (ACL):
  - ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.
___
  ### Attribute-based access control (ABAC) :
- ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a userâ€™s access request should be granted.
___
## RBAC implementation :

1. Inventory your systems :

   - Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. Examples would include an email system, customer database, contact management system, major folders on a file server, etc.

2. Analyze your workforce and create roles

   - You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible. 

   3- Assign people to roles:

    - Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly. 

    4- Never make one-off changes

     - Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary.
